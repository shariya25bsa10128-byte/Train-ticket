# Train-ticket
Overview:
This project is a multi-functional console-based application built in Python that simulates a Railway Reservation System. It utilizes the mysql.connector library to establish persistent data storage for all reservation records. The system allows users to book tickets with dynamic costing (based on train, class, and food), view past reservations by username, check PNR status, and cancel existing bookings. It demonstrates core concepts in database management, structured data handling, and robust I/O procedures.
