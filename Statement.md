Problem Statement
The central problem is the necessity for an integrated, reliable system capable of managing the life cycle of rail travel transactions. There is a need for a console application that can accurately process detailed customer input, perform dynamic cost calculations (factoring in train, class, seats, and taxes), and safely store, retrieve, and modify these records using a persistent database. This ensures transactional integrity and avoids data loss.
